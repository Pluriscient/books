\subsection{U Thrive: How to Succeed in College (and Life) (Dan Lerner, Alan Daniel Schlechter)}

While a bit too assertive to my taste, I listened to this book and found it containing a lot of the insights that I had collected over the years of reading self-development books as well as some new ones which I enjoyed very much. Good starter for anyone, though you should always take things with a grain of salt.
