\subsection{Loserthink (Scott Adams)}

Never thought I'd be reading a book that puts Trump in a mostly positive light and not feel like the author doesn't know anything.
Scott Adams made for a very interesting read about his concept of losethink. Loserthink being basically anything that doesn't help you, society, or your current conversation in any meaningful way.

\subsubsection{Summary of learning points}
Adams' approach was to go through the 'minds' of particular professions who each have particular methods for perceiving the world and seeing what we can learn from them.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Psychologist:
    \item Scientist
    \item Exonomist
    \item Historian
    \item Artist
    \item Leader: compare your plan to the next best one
\end{itemize}

Followed by a chapter of persuasion items that do not contribute (things done by political pundits that you shouldn't)
