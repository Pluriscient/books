Writing is more engaging to me than typing but I do not possess access to a notbeook atm so am consigned to cramping my hands on the plane.

One of the major goals in my life, as it is in that of many others, is to improve the world. At first glance this is quite a naive goal, and I must admit that as of this moment, it is. For what is 'improving', and what is 'the world' in this outline?
During the GMYF course I did the approach we studied from was to define each of the important terms first, and I actually think this is quite an essential part of understanding what you are doing (and want to do ;) )

Let's start with rephrasing the statement to be more complete: I wish to improve the state of the world through intentional acts than it would have been without my (active) engagement as such.

With 'The state of the world' *I* mean some combination of global welfare, climate, population, and other factors that I cannot come up with right now,Global welfare being the happiness and prosperity of the people.

I want it to be through my engagement because I am unable to see any different world than the one that I am in right now (or am led to perceive I am in, I can't say I know through first person perspective what state the world is in, just how I perceive it to be).

First steps first; What would a better world look like? I can honestly say that anything I hypothesize will be far from what *could* be a better world, ie. I only describe a single potential world out of many (potentially infinite) possible better worlds. Let's list some factors that determine the 'goodness' of a world:

 - The people (I would say Homo Sapiens but honesty just mean those I can talk with and sympathise with (yes, I do believe it is possible to sympathise with any Homo Sapiens))
   - Amount is important. More people to communicate with is more fun (so no small group of elites)
 - The fulfillment of the basic needs of those people
   - Contact with others
   - Food & water
   - Sanitary needs
   - Hygienic needs
   - Right
 - The fulfillment of the youth of these people
   - Education
