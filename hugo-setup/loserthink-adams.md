Loserthink (Scott Adams)
------------------------

Never thought I'd be reading a book that puts Trump in a mostly positive
light and not feel like the author doesn't know anything. Scott Adams
made for a very interesting read about his concept of losethink.
Loserthink being basically anything that doesn't help you, society, or
your current conversation in any meaningful way.

### Summary of learning points

Adams' approach was to go through the 'minds' of particular professions
who each have particular methods for perceiving the world and seeing
what we can learn from them.

-   Psychologist:

-   Scientist

-   Exonomist

-   Historian

-   Artist

-   Leader: compare your plan to the next best one

Followed by a chapter of persuasion items that do not contribute (things
done by political pundits that you shouldn't)
