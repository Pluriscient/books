Mindsets (Carol S. Dweck) [\[mindsets\]]{#mindsets label="mindsets"}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*Maybe a bit cheating but I'll first copy my summary from last week
here:*

In the book Mindsets, we learn about the two different mindsets people
can have in a field: a fixed mindset where nothing can change and one
must prove time and time again that the 'natural ability' was high
enough, and the growth mindset, where everything is capable of growth if
one tries hard enough in the right way. A fixed mindset that can no
longer breeze past an obstacle will fall, and fall hard, with no way to
get back up. Lacking talent cannot be overcome, and ways to avoid
looking like you failed are created, for instance by not putting any
effort in. A growth mindset can also fall, but unlike the former they
can always get back up again, knowing that trying harder or differently
in order to grow the skills necessary in order to be able to overcome
this obstacle in your way and continue on. This allows the grower to
maintain motivation and reach levels that the fixed-mind-setter is only
able to dream of.
