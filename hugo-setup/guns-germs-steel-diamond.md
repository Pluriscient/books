Guns, Germs, and Steel: The fates of Human Societies (Jared Diamond)

A really different look on history, dissecting history, geology, and
biology in order to find out why it is not the Native Americans but the
Europeans that colonised the world.

While his conclusions answer many questions they also ask us many other
ones anew.

In essence Jared says that it is mostly the ability to spread
geographically that determines speed of growth, along with basic
advantages such as tamable creatures, not (lack of) intelligence among
other peoples, something I can definitely agree with.
