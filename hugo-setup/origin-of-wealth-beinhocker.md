The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker
----------------------------------------

I received this book from my father for my 15th birthday because he
'could not read the small letters'. Now, 6 years later, I can consider
myself part of a set of readers extraordinary in their due diligence and
dedication for having finished this book. While written as a popular
introduction on the book, this 500-page literary work engulves one in
stats surrounding economic theory, both the incumbent current champion
of the day, 'Traditional Market Theory', as has been developed from Adam
Smith onwards, and a 'new' theory of complexity economics that finds its
basis in the concept of evolution instead of assumptions on rationality.
