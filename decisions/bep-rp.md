# Bachelor End Project or Research Project

## BEP

### Points

- Group Work
  - Not sure if I'll get a good group, especially considering that A. Jaap's gonna skip likely, B. Lots of ppl (Wolf?) I know will be doing the research project instead
- Experience with Work at job
  - Counterpoint: Should be getting this if I do a gap year
  - Could probably get an offer from ABN or AZG
- Usually easier but adjustable for more challenge
  - Only if the rest of the group agrees -> Like-minded?

## Research Project

- Possibly group work
  - Would want to do this in a group of like-minded people (so they should also like the same field)
- Would be superfluous if I also did my honours
  - Which is unlikely to be completed T_T

## Feelings

In general I feel like I'm tending towards RP now like I did towards BEP a few days ago, but I'm not sure whether this is a temporary one or not. 
Future regret is playing a role here unfortunately. I want to talk to mom and dad and Jaap.
