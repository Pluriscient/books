# Ideas

A collection of ideas that I have so I have somewhere to write them down when I feel inspired.

## For Projects

Ideas for potential projects that I could do

### Carykh-like animation of the voice

Carykh the youtuber has worked on automating his edit process, and my idea is to build on that with an Open Source Project that will allow the user to
- Create their own animated character (with configurable 'arms' and mouth)
- Have that mouth be automatically lip-synced using a process like Gentle 
- Have the character motion broadly sync up with a filmed selfie, perhaps with some shortcuts built in (think Kinect-like motion capture)

### Minecraft puzzles to learn Reasoning & Logic

It's hard to motivate kids to learn a subject like Reasoning & Logic, while it is quite useful at any point in life.
One way I want to try out is to create puzzles in Minecraft with increasing logic that will teach you these points

- I should do the abstract design on paper
- Let Oscar fo most of the implementations
- Perhaps use escape-room like puzzles, with some form of reward
    - Should make a level generator that gets given a logic puzzle in a form that's used for R&L
